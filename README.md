## Hi, I'm Niyati! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Bioinformatics Professional with a Masterâ€™s in Bioinformatics from University of Birmingham, specializing in Single-Cell & Bulk RNA Sequencing, NGS, and multi-omics studies. I bridge biology and informatics to extract actionable insights using data analysis, machine learning, and advanced visualization techniques.

### Key expertise:

  * RNA Sequencing & NGS Pipelines
  * Machine Learning & Data Analysis (Python, R)
  * Workflow Design & Bioinformatics Tools (Bioconductor, SAMtools)
  * Data Visualization (ggplot2, Matplotlib, Tableau)

### Notable Impact:

  * Oral presentation at ECCO Summit 2025 on IBD subtypes
  * Published abstract in Journal of Crohnâ€™s and Colitis
  * Optimized sequencing workflows to improve efficiency
  * Identified biomarkers for early disease detection

Iâ€™m passionate about contributing to transformative bioinformatics projects in healthcare and science.
