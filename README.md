## Hi, I'm Niyati! 👋

I am a Bioinformatics Professional with a Master’s in Bioinformatics from University of Birmingham, specializing in Bulk RNA Sequencing, NGS, and multi-omics studies. I bridge biology and informatics to extract actionable insights using data analysis, machine learning, and advanced visualization techniques. I enjoy collaborating with biologists, clinicians, and data scientists to uncover patterns that drive discovery and innovation.

### Key expertise:

  * RNA Sequencing & NGS Pipelines
  * Machine Learning & Data Analysis (Python, R, Bash)
  * Workflow Design & Bioinformatics Tools
  * Data Visualization (ggplot2, Matplotlib, Tableau, Complex Heatmaps)
  * Proficient in Single-Cell RNA-Seq analysis
  * Data management 


### Notable Impact:

  * Oral presentation at ECCO Summit 2025 on IBD subtypes
  * Published abstract in Journal of Crohn’s and Colitis 
  * Optimized sequencing workflows to improve efficiency
  * Identified biomarkers for early disease detection

I’m passionate about contributing to transformative bioinformatics projects in healthcare and science.
